## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that estimates house prices based on various features. The process involves:

1. **Importing Libraries and Dataset**: Loading necessary libraries and the dataset for analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling categorical and numerical variables, and identifying missing values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the distribution of features and the relationship between them.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Removing unnecessary columns, filling missing values, and preparing the dataset for modeling.
5. **Model Implementation**: Implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict house prices.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's accuracy using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

## Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle categorical and numerical data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand the dataset through visualization.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Impute missing values and remove unnecessary columns.
4. **One-Hot Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format.
5. **SVM Model**: Implement Support Vector Machine for regression analysis.
